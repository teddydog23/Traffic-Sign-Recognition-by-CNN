Step 1, install python 3.11 and all the modules, libraries required in requirements.txt

Step 2, download main.py, test.p, traffic_sign_classification.h5 (make sure that those files are in the same folder). Where main.py is graphical user interface, test.p is test datasets and traffic_sign_classification.h5 is the model.

Step3, run main.py.
A new window pops up, you can choose to predict an image of traffic sign in the attached folder 'Images_From_Google', or predict the random image.
